/*  Primitives are the data type that cannot be further divided like for example
*
* int a = 24;
* char name = 'c';
* float marks = 94.43;
*
* these are the data types that cannot be further divided
*
* But unlike string it is a non primitive data type
*
* char name = "India"
*
* it can be further divided into char so it is not a primitive data type
